APPROACH

Since, I've made games on C++ previously, I already had an idea on how to approach this game. I always begin with the basics and work my way up, so I first created just the chess board, then the ability to give names, then the ability to move and then the levels.

Firstly, the user is allowed to add values to the table

Then, the players play against each other using the command line interface

Finally, when one of te player loses all its pawns, the game ends.
